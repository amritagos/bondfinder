* Hello from Approval Tests.
*
* It looks like your program is calling some code that requires knowledge of
* the location of the main() in your source tree.
*
* To do this, add the following to your main.cpp file:
*
*     APPROVAL_TESTS_REGISTER_MAIN_DIRECTORY
*
* Currently, this is only required if you are using TemplatedCustomNamer's
* {RelativeTestSourceDirectory}.
*                                                                           *
