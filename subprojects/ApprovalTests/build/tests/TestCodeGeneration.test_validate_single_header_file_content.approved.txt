Testing validation of #include lines, with these header files: ['A.h', 'B.h'] and ['C.hpp']

===============================
Source snippet:
# Source code is fine: there should be no error message
#include <iostream>
#include "A.h"
#include "B.h"

=>
Error message (if any):

===============================
Source snippet:
# A.h is incorrectly included
#include <A.h>
#include "B.h"

=>
Error message (if any):

ERROR: There is an incorrect #include line somewhere in the library source.
The file A.h is incorrectly include via <>.
Search for "A.h>" in all the library source, and convert to double-quotes instead.

===============================
Source snippet:
# B.h and C.hpp are incorrectly included: there should ve error messages for both
#include <B.h>
#include <C.hpp>

=>
Error message (if any):

ERROR: There is an incorrect #include line somewhere in the library source.
The file B.h is incorrectly include via <>.
Search for "B.h>" in all the library source, and convert to double-quotes instead.

ERROR: There is an incorrect #include line somewhere in the library source.
The file C.hpp is incorrectly include via <>.
Search for "C.hpp>" in all the library source, and convert to double-quotes instead.
