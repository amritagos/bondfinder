Whenever we deprecate a method, the implementation of the deprecated method will always contain a single line, which is how we want the code to be called in the future.

As such, you can always open up the method to see how to convert your code.

If you IDE supports inlining, you can also select your old function call, and inline just that one line, and your IDE will update the code for you.

**Note** If you are reading this after we have removed the deprecated methods, please download a slightly earlier release, and then follow one of the steps above.
